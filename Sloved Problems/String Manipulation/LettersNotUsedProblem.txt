Problem 1
Letters Not Used

For this problem, you are interested in displaying a list of all letters that do not appear in a given
input string. The letters in the output will be lowercase, regardless of the case of the letters in the
input string.

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer n, (1 = n = 1000), which is the number of test
cases that follow. Each test case consists of a single line of input containing a string. Each
string is of length n, (1 = n = 80). All input strings will consist solely of letters and spaces,
no punctuation or special symbols.

Output
For each case, you should print out the statement :
Letters missing in case x:
where x is the case number. Place a colon immediately after the case number along with a single
space. This is followed by all the letters which are not used in the input. All letters should be
lowercase and in ascending sorted order from a to z.
