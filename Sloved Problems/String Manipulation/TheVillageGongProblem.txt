Problem 5
The Village Gong

In a certain remote village, monks announce the passage of time by striking a gong every ten
minutes throughout the day and night. The gong is struck at exactly midnight, and at every ten
minute interval after that, at 12:10:00, 12:20:00, etc. Your job is to figure out how long it will be
until the monks will next strike the gong.

Input
The first line of the input will be the number of test cases. On each subsequent line is a separate
test case. An instance of this problem is a string of the form <h>:<m>:<s> that represents the
current time in a 12-hour format, where h, m and s are integers and 1 = h = 12, 00 = m = 59, 00
= s = 59. The abbreviations "a.m." and "p.m." will not be specified in the input. They are
unnecessary.

Output
For each instance, your program is to determine the integer number of seconds until the next
strike of the gong. If the current time happens to be the precise moment when the gong is being
struck, then output 0.
