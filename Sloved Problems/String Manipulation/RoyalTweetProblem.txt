Problem 1
Royal Tweet

On October 24th, 2014, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II dipped a toe into 21st-century
communications when she posted her first tweet. Signing herself Elizabeth R., for regina or
queen, she welcomed visitors to a new Information Age gallery focused on the evolution of
modern communications at the Science Museum in London. The inaugural tweet (shown above)
was posted to the official British monarchy Twitter feed, which has more than 700,000
followers.

Your job is to write a program to scan a given number of tweets for how many mention the at
symbol to the British Monarchy, @BritishMonarchy. The username following the @ symbol
in Twitter is case insensitive.

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer n, (1 = n = 1000), which is the number of tweets
that follow. Each tweet consists of a single line of input containing a string. Each string is of
length n, (1 = n = 140). All tweets are separated by a single blank line.

Output
Output the total tweets that contain the substring @BritishMonarchy (regardless of case)
exactly in the format below. A given tweet that mentions @BritishMonarchy more than
once is legal and should not be double counted.
