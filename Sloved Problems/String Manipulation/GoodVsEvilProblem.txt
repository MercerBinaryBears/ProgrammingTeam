Problem 2
Good or Evil?

You are trying to figure out whether a character is good or evil. Well, it’s easy to tell! You just
have to count up the number of g’s and e’s in their name. If they have more g’s, they are good, if
they have more e’s, they are bad. Think about it, the greatest hero of them all, Algorithm
Crunching Man is good since he has two g’s and no e’s. What about Tux (the Linux Penguin)?
Well, the name Tux has no g’s and no e’s so he must be neutral. Any name with the same
number of g’s and e’s is deemed neutral. Be sure to ignore case in your solution (i.e., count
uppercase and lowercase g’s and e’s the same).

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer n, (1 = n = 1000), which is the number of test
cases that follow. Each test case consists of a single line of input containing a string. Each
string is of length n, (1 = n = 80).

Output
For each test case, you should generate one line of output with the name followed by a single
space, followed by is, a single space, and then followed by either GOOD, EVIL, or NEUTRAL
based on the relation of g’s to e’s. Each result should appear on a separate line.
