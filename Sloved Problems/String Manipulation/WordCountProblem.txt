Problem 8
Word Count
Microsoft Word now automatically displays the number of words in your documents on the
status bar at the bottom of the workspace.
You can even click on Words from the status bar to find the total characters and lines in your file
too. This is nothing new on the Linux operating system which has always included a word count
command called wc that displays the number of lines, words, and bytes in a text file to the
screen. These are each defined as follows.
- lines - total end of line characters in the file.
- words - total tokens in the file. A token starts and ends with a printable, non-whitespace
character. A whitespace character is a space, tab, or end of line character.
- bytes - total characters in the file including all whitespace characters.
You have been asked to implement the classic wc Linux system command to calculate the total
lines, words, and bytes as defined above.

Input
Your program should accept a single test case consisting of one or more strings of length n,
(2 = n = 80). Input is terminated by the end of file, and the last character in the file will
always be an end of line character.

Output
Output the total number of lines, words, and bytes exactly as shown below.

Sample Input
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
Everything else is secondary."
-Steve Jobs, 2005 Stanford Commencement

Output Corresponding to Sample Input
Lines = 5
Words = 40
Bytes = 250
