Problem 1
SMILE! :-)

September 19, 1982 — On this day, a Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor
named Scott E. Fahlman posted a smiley face :-) on an electronic message board.
Not just content to remain a frozen smirk, it has learned to wink ;-) and stick out its tongue :-p.
Sometimes it gets sad :-( or confused :-S, and sometimes it's scared =:-0 but most of the time it's
cheerful :-D.
As it grew older, it had its first kiss :-* and smoked its first cigarette :-Q and even grew its hair
out &:-). It's shown its fashion sense, too, sporting sunglasses B-) and baseball caps d:-), and
even the occasional bow tie :-)8.
