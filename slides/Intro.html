                <h2>What is Programming Team?</h2>
                <p>
                    Programming Team is a group of people that practice and compete in competitions held thought the year. 
                    The goal is to solve all the problems in as little time as possible.  
                </p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>
                    Problems vary in difficulty based on competition. <br>
                    Small College - Easier Problems <br>
                    ACM - Much Harder <br>
                    Mercer Competition - Mix of Both Types
                </p>

                            Teams with the most problems solved win. In the case of a tie all the problem submission times are added and any incorrect submissions add 20 additional minutes for each. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Example For One Problem</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You submit the problem twice, but get the problem wrong (time limit exceeded, presentation error, etc.)</li>
                            <li>You finally get it right the third time, 45 minutes after the competition has started</li>
                            <li>As a result, you would get *20* penalty for the first incorrect submission, *20* for the second, and *45* for the correct submission, totalling *85* points</li>
                            <li>So, it's best to get the problem *as quickly as possible* and *without making any mistakes*</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Example For Two Teams</h3>
                        <p>Consider the following two teams:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team A has solved 5 problems, with a total of 600 penalty points</li>
                            <li>Team B has solved 4 problems, with a total of 500 penaly points</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Team A would win in this case, because <em>they solved more problems</em>
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Another Two Team Example</h3>
                        <p>Consider this case instead:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team A has solved 5 problems, with a total of 600 penalty points</li>
                            <li>Team B fixed a bug and has now solved 5 problems, with a total of 550 penalty points</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Now, Team B would be the winner because in the case that two teams have the same number of solved problems,
                            <em>the team with the least number of penalty points breaks the tie</em>.
                        </p>

                <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Major tech companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc, all interview and hire based on very similar methods and problems.
