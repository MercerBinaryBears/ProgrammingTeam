        <h1>10/19 - Intro to Graph Theory</h1>
        <p>
        This week, we'll be expanding on our Python tutorial by delving into strings as well as basic data structures.
        Python is an excellent language to quickly and efficiently parse through strings, which is a huge part in many programming 
        team competitions.

        <h3>Delving Deeper</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://problems.aprilandchip.com/problems/160/pdf" target="_blank">This problem</a> is a good way
            to whet your appetite on playing with graphs. It will force you to not only build a graph, but to update weights
            and traverse the graph.  
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing you may want to try is to use <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs" 
            target="_blank">different methods of representing graphs</a> when you attempt this problem. Weigh out the pros and cons of each
            approach and decide which is your prefered method.
