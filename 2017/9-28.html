        <h1>Combinatorics</h1>
        <p>
        This week, we're focusing on combinatorics, or counting things! This shows up in competitions all the time,
        and judges (especially Chip), <em>love</em> writing combinatorics problems. Be careful, integer overflows
        abound here! You'll need to watch all of your intermediate calculations to make sure they don't get too big.

                Read <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/recursion-problem-solving/">this article</a> about solving
                problems recursively. Be sure to work through those examples! Many counting problems are easier to work
                out if done solved recursively.

        <h2>Delving Deeper</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://problems.aprilandchip.com/problems/230/pdf">Here is a counting problem</a> that's very
            elegant if written recursively. However, do note that the recursive function that models this problem uses
            <em>a second variable</em> aside from <code>k</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also worth noting that this problem is not only recursive, but exhibits <em>Optimal Substructure</em>.
            That means that it's solution can be computed efficiently from smaller versions of the problem (it's
            recursive nature). Moreover, it has <em>Overlapping Subproblems</em>, meaning C(k, n) might end up
            calculating smaller subproblems multiple times. However,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">Dynamic Programming</a> provides relief to this
            problem (see the first paragraph, and the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#In_computer_programming">"In Computer Programming"
            </a> section.
