        <h1>9/21 - Python Intro, Strings and Iterables</h1>
        <p>
        This week, we'll be expanding on our Python tutorial by delving into strings as well as basic data structures.
        Python is an excellent language to quickly and efficiently parse through strings, which is a huge part in many programming 
        team competitions.
        </p>

        <h2>Sorting and Searching</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">the intro here</a>. Why might sorting be
                important?
            </li>
            <li>
                Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZuD6iUe3Pc">this video</a> comparing different
                sorting algorithms, and their behavior in different situations. Don't worry about how they're
                implemented, but do pay attention to the ones that are faster and slower.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have a sorted array, Binary search can help you quickly find the index of an element in that
                array. This is extremely important for very large arrays where the difference between <code>O(n)</code>
                and <code>O(log(n))</code> can be the difference between a second and an hour! Read
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">the Wikipedia page</a> intro and the
                "Procedure" subsection. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhciTuD3E8">This video</a> will help
                too

            <li>
                <a href="https://visualgo.net/en/sorting">This website</a> provides a cool way to interactively learn
                about the different sorting algorithms and see a live example of the code on the side.

        <h3>Try it out!</h3>
        <p>
        <a href="http://problems.aprilandchip.com/problems/149/pdf" target="_blank">Here's a good intro problem.</a> 
        This requires you to use built in string functions to get meta information on the provided strings. 
        </p>
        <h3>Delving Deeper</h3>
        <p>
        Check out <a href="http://problems.aprilandchip.com/problems/170/pdf" target="_blank">this problem</a>. This
        problem can be made trivial with the <code>in</code> operator in Python.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research the <code>in</code> operator some more. How does it actually work under the hood?</li>
            <li>
                Write a "naive" solution to this problem (using loops and <em>not</em> built-in operators/libraries)
                and try running it on a larger case (a necklace with 100,000 beads). How fast is it?
            </li>
            <li>

                in particular, <em>Knuth-Morris-Pratt</em> is fairly efficient.
