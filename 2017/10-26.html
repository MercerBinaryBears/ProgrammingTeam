        <h1>Graph Theory Part 2</h1>
        <p>
            This week, we're continuing our discussion of graph theory and working on some more difficult topics

        <p>
        As you can see, there's not a lot of things up there to look at! However, these are tricky topics
        that you'll really need to understand for competitions. But if you're wanting more the
        <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/maximum-flow/tutorial/">Maximum Flow Problem</a>
        also shows up at ACM, but is fairly complex. Beware! Here's
        <a href="http://problems.aprilandchip.com/problems/156/pdf">a great problem</a> that you can use to work through
        building out maximum flow, along with teasing out the graph structure.
